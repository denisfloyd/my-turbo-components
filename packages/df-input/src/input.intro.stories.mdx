# Input - Get started

Custom input react component built with tailwindcss. It allow users to enter, select and search for text.

## Install

Add Input to your project.

`npm install --save df-input`

` * added styles.css to your application *`

```
import 'df-input/styles.css'
```

## **Use**

### Input

`import Input from 'df-input';`

```
  const example = () => (
    <div>
       <Input />
    </div>
  )
```

## Override styles

You can easily override any style of component just adding a custom tailwind class inside element's `className` property. For that, it's required to have tailwindcss as a dependency and setup on the project.
